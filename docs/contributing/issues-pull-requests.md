We use GitHub issues to report problems, request and track changes, and discuss future ideas.
If you open an issue for a specific problem, please follow the template guides.

## Pull Requests

We use the standard GitHub contribution cycle where all contributions are made via pull requests (including code owners!).

1. Fork the repository and clone to your local machine.
1. Create a branch for your changes using a descriptive name for the change, such as the issue being addressed.
   ```
   git checkout -b {user}-issue-{xx}
   ```
1. Create your changes.
    - Please open an issue to discuss larger changes; bug fixes and minor changes do not require an issue.

    - Keep commits focused and use clear messages.
    - Avoid committing unrelated changes in the same PR.
